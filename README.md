Forum Thread: <https://community.7daystodie.com/topic/12269-white-river-tools-of-citizenship-quests-a191/>

Parent Quest Pack: <https://github.com/XelaNull/7DTD-WhiteRiver_ToC/>

Tested with A19.3

This modlet modifies the Tools of Citizenship quest pack so that the quest rewards that are given out are in-line with Darkness Falls item leveling. This modlet is considered REQUIRED only if you are using the White River - Tools of Citizenship with Darkness Falls.

**This modlet pack is only XML XPath modlets and only needs to be installed on the server!**
